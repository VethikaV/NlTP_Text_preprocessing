# NlTP_Text_preprocessing

Text Preprocessing and Bag-of-Words Model
This repository demonstrates text preprocessing techniques and the creation of a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model using Python. Key features include:

Text Cleaning: Removal of special characters, stopwords, and stemming or lemmatization of words.
Custom Corpus: Illustrates processing on a small corpus of sample sentences.
Bag-of-Words Model: Uses CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to generate unigram, bigram, and trigram features for text representation.
Parameterization: Customizable options like max_features and ngram_range for the CountVectorizer.
Key Libraries
nltk: For tokenization and stopword removal.
scikit-learn: For creating the BoW model.
Example Output
Cleaned text corpus.
Vocabulary generated by the BoW model with unigram, bigram, and trigram features.
Usage
Clone the repository, install the necessary libraries, and run the script to explore how text preprocessing and BoW models work.
